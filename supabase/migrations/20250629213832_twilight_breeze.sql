  # Storage bucket setup (manual step required)

  This migration handles storage configuration that can be done programmatically.

  ## Manual Steps Required:
  1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage
  2. Create a new bucket named 'audio-recordings'
  3. Set it as private (not public)
  4. The RLS policies will be handled automatically by Supabase for authenticated users

  ## What this migration does:
  - Documents the storage requirements
  - Ensures the entries table is properly set up to reference storage files
*/

-- (This should already be created by the previous migration, but we'll make sure)
